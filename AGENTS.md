# Agent Conventions

This repository assumes the following defaults when working with AI coding agents.

- Language: Japanese
- Tone: concise, implementation-focused, CLI-friendly
- Code comments and explanations: Japanese unless existing code dictates otherwise
- Formatting: plain text suitable for terminal output
- Font assumption for examples and screenshots: JetBrains Mono

These conventions are meant to keep interactions consistent across sessions.
